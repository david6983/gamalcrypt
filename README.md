# Gamalcrypt project

two simple cryptography algorithms in java.

## Context

The project was originally an assignment from our lecturer in computer system security
at the [Uuniversity of Putra Malaysia (UPM)](http://www.upm.edu.my/) in Malaysia.

We decided to make this simple classes open-source for contribution.

## Presentation

This project is an implementation of two cryptographic algorithm in java.
- The first algorithm is an [El-gamal encryption system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_encryption).
- The second project is a custom-made algorithm provided in the subject of the assignment.

## Note for kotlin implementation

- I decided to include a version of Cryptorithm class in kotlin without any swing interface to use it in further project
- Of course all the classes in java in this project can be easily used in kotlin
